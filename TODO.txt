4) stackoverflow https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/66050/find-the-address-of-the-wallet-know-almost-all-the-letters/144254#144254

5) online question https://www.reddit.com/r/etherscan/comments/wtc5zd/way_to_search_with_partial_address/

6) only query addresses not the full transaction.

7) index 1 million addresses and measure time

8) build dirty MVP frontend in NodeJS

10) sort documents results by ETH balance.

11) add initial "x" and end of address token to expand on queries of type "0xa3f...8a1a"

12) User 4-grams to have smaller lists per n-grams, instead of 3-grams.

13) find fragment that is the most easy to remember (pairs, sequential values, triples) when compressing, example 345bba2

----------------------------

DONE!

3) DO Filesystem version!! pickle object local files!

9) build API in Python. https://towardsdatascience.com/the-right-way-to-build-an-api-with-python-cd08ab285f8f
    a) supports http://localhost:5002/expand?fragment=7432..0f67
    b) supports http://localhost:5002/expand?fragment=743257f


------------------------------

FROZEN!

1) use this implementation, the sqlite one is too slow!

2) Use simple frontend
